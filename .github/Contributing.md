* Create a new branch (with a clear name of what is being changed).
* Add changes to CHANGELOG.md with credits to yourself.
* Commit your changes.
* When writing commit messages make sure they are clear about what has been changed.
* Push the commit(s) to your fork.
* Submit a pull request (PR) to the master branch.
* The PR title should describe the change that has been made.
* Follow the PR template and write as much detail as necessary for your changes and include documents/screenshots if needed.
* Be prepared to answer any questions about your PR when it is reviewed for acceptance.
