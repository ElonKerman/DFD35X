## Description
DFD35X is an open-source project started by Digital Flight Dynamics in order to create a realistic and high-quality Airbus A350 XWB for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
At the moment this project is still in very early stages, so if you contribute, we would highly appreciate it. If you want to follow our frequent progress updates, join our discord server above.

## FAQ
**1. When will the DFD35X project be released as Version 1.0?**  
The aircraft will release when models & systems are complete, and polished to the point where it has little to no bugs.  
  
**2. Will this aircraft be study-level?**  
Study-level is a term that is overused in flight simulation. It's basically like clickbait on a YouTube video but for FS aircraft addons. However I can assure you that the systems will be close to real life to have maximum immersion.  
  
**3. Will it have a custom cockpit?**  
Yes. This addon will have a highly accurate custom cockpit, as opposed to most other current addons that use the default cockpits from other aircraft.
